Miscellaneous Information regarding functions and processes used in project - mostly new stuff I learned

task_struct - vital part of linux kernel; each process has one
    - stores many fields including PID, parent process pointer, process state, priority, etc. 

ptrace system call info: 
    - Causes Two Main Requests for tracing system calls: PTRACE_TRACEME, PTRACE_SYSCALL
        - PTRACE_TRACEME: Child process calls before execve, declares parent process as tracer
            - Parent proc pointer stored in child's task struct 
         - PTRACE_SYSCALL: Called by parent for each syscall in child
            - Child stops two times at each system call - once on entry, once on exit
